  Fixes:
    - fixed a bleed over effect in which more then one power pole got added if multiple other seeds came before it (might break your seed, be warned.)
    - fixed an issue that it could not handle fuel_categories as a power input. As well as items with that.

  Settings:
    - removed settings that no longer did anything
    - added a setting to force some items to be craftiable before the first science pack
    - added a setting so you can log more items and what they cost
    - added a setting that allows you to ignore seeds that take specific items in the crafting of science packs. By default that is wood and fish.
    - You can keep the icon with the result it made origionally

  Changes:
    - Used a sledge hammer and a broom to remove the old way of randomizing and settings related to that.
    - the log file contains an estimation of the cost of each science pack

  Locale:
    - removed text no longer in use.
