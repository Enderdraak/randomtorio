[mod-setting-description]
randomtorio-results=This will randomize the results of all the recipes. This does respect the crafting catagories.
randomtorio-ingredients=This will randomize the ingredients of all the recipes. This does respect the crafting catagories.
randomtorio-check-possible=The mod will find a seed that should be possible to do. This might take a few minutes to a few days.\nSuffling results as well takes way longer. I recommend only suffling ingredients for faster loading time.\nI recommend that you look in the log file (and scroll all the way down) to get the seed that is possible and put that into the seed to make loading faster.
randomtorio-randomseed=This is the starting value of the randomizer. The same seed will give the same results.\nFor the base game the seed 47605 works for only mixing ingredients on normal.\n93443 works for expensive recipes for ingredients only.
randomtorio-check-amount=The "Find a possible seed" needs to be something other then "Disable" for this to have an effect. This setting will limit the amount of times it tries to find a seed and afterwards still forcefully startup. Even if no seed is found.\nBy my own testing about 230 seeds can be looked trough a second.
randomtorio-first-randomizer=This is the first randomizer that I made. It does not work that great and with my own findings it can take more then 80 hours to find a combination that shuffles results that might be possible (crafting categories are not getting checked). For now it is getting left in so I can compare the new one that I am making.
randomtorio-normal-or-expensive=The game has 2 difficulty settings. I did not want to program around that so you can pick your choice in the startup and have that choice not matter anymore.
